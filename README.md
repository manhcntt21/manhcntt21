Hi everyone! 👋👋👋

My name is Mạnh, but it's too hard for some foreign people to pronounce, so you can call me David.

I spent my childhood growing up in Hung Ha district, Thai Binh province, but I've been living in Hanoi sence 2015.

There are four people in my family, I live with my brother in Hanoi and my parents live in Thai Binh. I'm sill single and I have no plans to get marriaged.

I love listening to music and reading book in my free time, because I don't have much time and it makes me feel relaxed. Furthermore I live getting out of city on the weekend to explore the surrounding areas.

Luckily, I'm a computer science graduate with a very good degree. I have three years of experience in Java Development, special with Spring Boot framework.

That's all, thank for taking the time to reading about me. I look forward to receiving your help in my repositories by performing pull requests to all my projects.

David.
